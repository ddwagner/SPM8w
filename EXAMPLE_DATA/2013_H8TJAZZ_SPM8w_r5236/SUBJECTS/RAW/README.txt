SPM8w Tutorial Data Raw Files
In order to maintain the anonimity of our tutorial subjects, anatomical
MRIs are not provided in the original PAR/REC. Instead, we provide 
NIFTI files which have been defaced, maintaining brain but preventing 
3D reconstruction of face. To test PAR/REC conversion, follow the 
instructions in the SPM8w guide and then manually copy the provided 
mprage.nii.gz files from the SUBJECTS/RAW/subid_mprage directory to the 
SUBJECTS/subid/NIFTI directory. 

In order to reduce the filesize of the example dataset, it is necessary that
everyone convert the raw data from PAR/REC to NIFTI regardless of whether
they have any need for testing PAR/REC conversion. See the SPM8w guide 
for more details on how to convert the raw data (hint: it's easy and
really quick).

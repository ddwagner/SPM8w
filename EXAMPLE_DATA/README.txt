SPM8w
=====
This directory contains the example dataset (2013_H8TJAZZ_r5236) which consists of 
three subjects worth of data (anonymized, mri defaced and used with permission)
and a set of scripts that show how to organize your data for - and run analyses
with- SPM8w. 

In order to reduce the filesize of the example dataset, only raw data (PAR/REC)
are provided therefore the first step in using the example dataset is to 
covert it to nifti (using spm8w_nifticonverter.m and a local install of R2AGUI).
See the SPM8w guide for more details.
